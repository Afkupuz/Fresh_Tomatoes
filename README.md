# Fresh_Tomatoes  
The first project as part of Udacity's Full Stack NanoDegree program  
  
##The project:  
1. Install Python  
2. Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.  
3. Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.  
4. To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py - this module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.  
5. Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.   

##Grading:  
Grade criteria was based on the functionality, code quality, and documentation.  
  
Extra points were offered for added functionality

##My Project:  

  To run  
    1. Clone the repository  
    2. Launch your prefered python software and run entertainment_center.py  
    3. An HTML document will be created and launched in your prefered browser  
      
  What to look for:  
    1. Understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript that allowed for modification of the website (extra credit)  
    2. Understanding and use of basic Python as a web server  
    3. Working, polished, interactive website page product
