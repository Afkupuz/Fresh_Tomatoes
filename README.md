# Fresh_Tomatoes
The first project as part of Udacity's Full Stack NanoDegree program

The project:
1. Install Python
2. Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
3. Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
4. To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py - this module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
5. Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser. 

Grading:
Grade criteria was based on the functionality, code quality, and documentation.

Extra points were offered for added functionality

My Project:

  To run
    1. Clone the repository
    2. Launch your prefered python software and run entertainment_center.py
    3. An HTML document will be created and launched in your prefered browser
    
  What to look for:
    1. Understanding of HTML/CSS/JavaScript that allowed for modification of the website (extra credit)
    2. Understanding and use of basic Python as a web server
    3. Working, polished, interactive website page product
